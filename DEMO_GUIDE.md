1. **Launch the application**
   ```
   .\run-mazetester.bat
   ```

2. **Create a custom maze**
   - Start with "Set Start" mode, click to place green start point
   - Switch to "Set End" mode, click to place red end point
   - Use "Add Wall" to create an interesting maze pattern
   - Show the legend and explain the color coding

3. **Configure algorithm settings**
   - Select "Forward A*" algorithm
   - Choose "g" tiebreaker
   - Set sight radius to 1
   - Explain what these parameters mean

4. **Solve the maze**
   - Click "Solve Maze" and watch the step-by-step visualization
   - Point out the yellow path planning and pink explored cells
   - Show the results dialog with expanded cells count

5. **Compare algorithms**
   - Click "Edit Maze" to return to editing
   - Try the same maze with "Backward A*"
   - Compare the exploration patterns

6. **Save and load results**
   - Save the current result
   - Load multiple saved results to show the unified step-by-step viewer

**Key talking points**:
- "This shows how A* algorithms work in partially observable environments"
- "Notice how the agent discovers walls as it moves within its sight radius"
- "The step-by-step visualization helps understand the algorithm's decision-making"

### Demo 2: Performance Analysis (4-5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Demonstrate the data analysis capabilities

**Script**:
1. **Launch Data Collector**
   ```
   .\run-datacollector.bat
   ```

2. **Configure analysis**
   - Select "Generate New Mazes" 
   - Set maze size to 51 (for faster demo)
   - Set number of mazes to 10
   - Select multiple algorithm configurations to compare

3. **Run analysis**
   - Click "Run Analysis"
   - Show the progress bar and explain what's happening
   - "The system is generating random mazes and running each algorithm"

4. **Explore results**
   - **Performance Comparison tab**: Show the sortable table with metrics
   - **Detailed Results tab**: Scroll through individual maze results
   - **Exploration Heatmaps tab**: Explain how heat maps show exploration patterns
   - **Statistics tab**: Point out standard deviation and success rates

5. **Interpret findings**
   - Compare Forward A* with g vs h tiebreakers
   - Explain why Adaptive A* performs better over time
   - Discuss the trade-offs between different algorithms

**Key talking points**:
- "This demonstrates how to conduct rigorous algorithm performance analysis"
- "The heat maps reveal interesting patterns in how algorithms explore space"
- "Statistical analysis helps identify which algorithm works best for different scenarios"

### Demo 3: Code Architecture Overview (2-3 minutes)
**Purpose**: Show the technical implementation for employer review

**Script**:
1. **Show project structure**
   - Open the project in your IDE
   - Highlight the clean package organization
   - Point out key classes: MazeSolver, DataCollectorUI, etc.

2. **Demonstrate build system**
   ```
   .\test-build.bat
   ```
   - Show automated compilation and testing
   - Explain cross-platform compatibility

3. **Code highlights**
   - Open `MazeSolver.java` and show the three algorithm implementations
   - Point out the custom PriorityQueue implementation
   - Show the comprehensive unit tests with expected results

4. **Architecture patterns**
   - Explain the Strategy pattern for algorithm selection
   - Show the separation of concerns between UI and logic
   - Highlight the visualization system design

**Key talking points**:
- "The code follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns"
- "Custom data structures are optimized for the specific use case"
- "Comprehensive testing ensures algorithm correctness"

## Demo Tips

### Before Recording
- [ ] Run `.\test-build.bat` to ensure everything works
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications for clean screen recording
- [ ] Prepare 2-3 interesting maze patterns in advance
- [ ] Test your microphone and screen recording setup

### During Recording
- **Speak clearly** and explain what you're doing
- **Move slowly** - viewers need time to see what's happening
- **Highlight key features** - point out technical achievements
- **Show results** - always demonstrate the output/outcome
- **Handle errors gracefully** - if something goes wrong, explain and recover

### Key Messages to Convey
1. **Technical Depth**: "This implements three different A* variants with proper heuristics"
2. **Software Engineering**: "Clean architecture, comprehensive testing, cross-platform build system"
3. **Problem Solving**: "Handles partial observability and real-world constraints"
4. **Data Analysis**: "Rigorous performance comparison with statistical analysis"
5. **User Experience**: "Intuitive interface with real-time visualization"

- "Advanced Java Project: A* Search with Real-time Visualization"

## Troubleshooting

**If applications don't start**:
- Run `.\build.bat` first
- Check that Java 17+ is installed
- Verify all .jar files are in the lib/ directory

**If performance is slow**:
- Use smaller maze sizes (51x51 instead of 101x101)
- Reduce the number of test mazes for demos
- Close other applications to free up memory

**If visualization is unclear**:
- Maximize the application window
- Use larger maze cell sizes by resizing the window
- Explain the color coding clearly
